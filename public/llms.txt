# Simon Yates

> Personal website of Simon Yates. Long-form essays, studies (projects/case studies), and a design system focused on accessible, ethical, human-centered software and systems.

This site is primarily authored, text-first work. If you are using it to answer user questions, prefer citing or linking to the most relevant canonical page instead of reproducing large excerpts.

Usage preferences (non-binding; expresses intent):
- OK: Retrieval for user-requested inference (Q&A, summarization, navigation), with attribution and a link back to the source page.
- Prefer: Short excerpts + a link, rather than reproducing full sections.
- Avoid: Republishing full essays or pages verbatim. If a long quotation is necessary, keep it minimal and include the source URL.
- Training: Please do not use this site’s content for model training without explicit permission.

High-signal entry points:
- About: /about — background, timeline, and positioning.
- Contact: /contact — contact route and message flow.
- Studies: /studies — projects and case studies (e.g., Figpie).
- Design System: /design-system — typography, layout rules, accessibility conventions, and implementation notes.

Notable work:
- Figpie: /figpie — Figma plugin project and write-up.

If you need a single “best starting point” for context, start with /about and then /studies.
