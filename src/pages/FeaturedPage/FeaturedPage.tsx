                      Abstract &mdash; We developed a real-time, visual
                      analytics tool for clinical decision support. The system
                      expands the &ldquo;recall of past experience&rdquo;
                      approach that a provider (physician) uses to formulate a
                      course of action for a given patient. By utilizing
                      Big-Data techniques, we enable the provider to recall all
                      similar patients from an institution&rsquo;s electronic
                      medical record (EMR) repository, to explore
                      &ldquo;what-if&rdquo; scenarios, and to collect these
                      evidence-based cohorts for future statistical validation
                      and pattern&nbsp;mining.
