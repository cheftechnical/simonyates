          Mayo Clinic is an American nonprofit academic medical center based in
          Rochester, MN, focused on integrated patient care, education and
          research. It employs over 4,500 physicians and scientists, along with
          58,400 administrative and allied health&nbsp;staff.

          The Patient Like Mine project was a real-time, visual analytics tool
          for clinical decision support. The System expands the &ldquo;recall of
          past experience&rdquo; approach that a provider (physician) uses to
          formulate a course of action for a given patient. By utilizing Big
          Data techniques, we enable the provider to recall all similar patients
          from an institution&rsquo;s electronic medical record (EMR)
          repository, to explore &ldquo;what-if&rdquo; scenarios, and to collect
          these evidence-based cohorts for future statistical validation and
          pattern&nbsp;mining.
