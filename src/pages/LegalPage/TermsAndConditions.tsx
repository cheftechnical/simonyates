        our Services or try to access them using a method other than the
        interface and the instructions that we provide. You may use our Services
        only as permitted by law, including applicable export and re-export

        violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content
        tat we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. But that
        does not necessarily mean that we review content, so please don&rsquo;t
        assume that we&nbsp;do.

        About these Terms

      <p className="font-normal text-base leading-6 tracking-[0.5px] mt-6">
        We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a
        Service to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our
        Services. You should look at the terms regularly. We&rsquo;ll post
        notice of modifications to these terms on this page. We&rsquo;ll post
        notice of modified additional terms in the applicable Service. Changes
        will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than
        fourteen days after they are posted. However, changes addressing new
        functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons will be
        effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified terms for a
        Service, you should discontinue your use of that&nbsp;Service.

        If you do not comply with these terms, and we don&rsquo;t take action
