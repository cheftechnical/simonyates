            It was around this time that I also started getting into model
            trains. <em>Model Railroader Magazine</em> would often include
            snippets of BASIC code that allowed you to control the COM port on
            your computer; or simulate waybills for imaginary companies that
            your trains had to make deliveries for. It was these snippets that
            would introduce me to new programming&nbsp;concepts.

            As I grew older, making things and solving problems through code
            became the norm for me. And in an unexpected twist, model trains
            actually taught me a lot about logistical efficiencies. After all, a
            model railroad&rsquo;s &ldquo;layout&rdquo; (the organization of
            track), is essentially just a flowchart diagram built in the
            physical&nbsp;world.

            While I don&rsquo;t play with trains anymore, I rediscovered the fun
            of electronics through an Arduino, so stay tuned to see what I make
            with&nbsp;that.
